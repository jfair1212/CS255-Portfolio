# CS255-Portfolio

1. The client wanted to create a system to help train new drivers. It allows users to create an account and purchase different driving packages that contain differing amounts of on-the-road driving practice, in-person learning, and practice tests.
2. I think that I did particularly well with creating the business requirements document. I think I captured perfectly what the client wanted from the system.
3. If I could go back over it, I would probably redo some of the charts to give them mroe detail and more accurately portray their information.
4. You have to really listen to the client and adhere to what they want. If you don't, then the final product will not satisfy them.
5. I think the methods we learned in this class will be extremely useful in the future. The thorough way we gathered requirements and then displayed them through graphs and charts is something that I will use in my future career to ensure that customer's needs are met.
